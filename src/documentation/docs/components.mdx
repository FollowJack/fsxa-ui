Individual components that can be used in the project are described here. 
These can be combined with each other in own sections.
<br />
Each individual component already contains the logic that it needs to fulfill its task. 
With the help of properties the optics or the function mode can be adapted thereby, so that the own requirements can be fulfilled.
