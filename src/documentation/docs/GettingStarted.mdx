  subtitle="FSXA-UI is really easy to get started with. Make sure to follow the guide below to get a better understanding about some of the decisions behind FSXA-UI and how to use it to kick-off your next project."

## Install

You can install FSXA-UI via Yarn or NPM.

```bash
# with npm
npm install fsxa-ui --save

# with yarn
yarn add fsxa-ui
```

<br />

Please make sure that the **main CSS file**  is imported from the FSXA UI package.

```typescript
// directly importing the css into your main component
import "fsxa-ui/dist/fsxa-ui.css";
```

```css
/* using node-style package resolution in a CSS file */
@import "fsxa-ui/dist/fsxa-ui.css";
```

```html
<!-- using plain html -->
<link
  href="path/to/node_modules/fsxa-ui/dist/fsxa-ui.css"
  rel="preload"
  as="style"
/>
```

## Usage

Now you can use the components in your project.
In the navigation you will find all available components with a detailed description of all properties and usage examples.

Here you can see how easy the `Button` component can be used.

```typescript
import { Button } from "fsxa-ui";

<Button variant="animated" handleClick={handleClick}>
  This is my Button
</Button>
```

Please make sure that your component is registered correctly.
