## Import

Import components from FSXA-UI.

Don't forget to include the **main CSS file** from the FSXA-UI package!

```typescript
// directly importing the css into your main component
import "fsxa-ui/dist/fsxa-ui.css";
```

```css
/* using node-style package resolution in a CSS file */
@import "fsxa-ui/dist/fsxa-ui.css";
```

```html
<!-- using plain html -->
<link
  href="path/to/node_modules/fsxa-ui/dist/fsxa-ui.css"
  rel="preload"
  as="style"
/>
```
