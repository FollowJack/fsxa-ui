## Install

You can install FSXA-Pattern-Library via Yarn or NPM.

```bash
# with npm
npm install fsxa-pattern-library --save

# with yarn
yarn add fsxa-pattern-library
```

## Import

Import components from FSXA-Pattern-Library.

```typescript
import { FSXAPage } from "fsxa-pattern-library";

<FSXAPage path={currentPath} handleRouteChange={handleRouteChange} />
```

<br />

Don't forget to include the **main CSS file** from the FSXA-Pattern-Library package!

```typescript
// directly importing the css into your main component
import "fsxa-package-library/dist/fsxa-package-library.css";
```

```css
/* using node-style package resolution in a CSS file */
@import "fsxa-package-library/dist/fsxa-package-library.css";
```

```html
<!-- using plain html -->
<link
  href="path/to/node_modules/fsxa-package-library/dist/fsxa-package-library.css"
  rel="preload"
  as="style"
/>
```

## Vuex

This project uses Vuex to store asynchronous data.

To facilitate the integration, we provide both a fully configured Vuex-Store and Vuex-Module.

### Integrate into vue-cli project using your own Vuex-Store

```typescript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

import {} from ""

Vue.use(Vuex);

const store = new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    count: 0
  },
  mutations: {
    increment (state) {
      state.count++
    }
  }
})
store.registerModule("fsxa", )
```

### Integrate into Nuxt


This project is using <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vuex</a> for State-Management purposes.

The underlying structure is exposed to you through the [FSXABaseComponent](/#/components/FSXABaseComponent).

It is used to store data fetched from CaaS and the Navigation-Service and is exposed to you as a consumer to store your own data as well.

## Server Side Rendering

This project supports server side rendering (SSR), but can also be used without it.

Required data is fetched on the client side only if it has not already been fetched in an SSR process.

Thanks to the integration of [Vuex](/#/vuex-integration), client-side hydration works out of the box.

For more information about SSR and how you can integrate it, see our [server side rendering section](/#/server-side-rendering).
