<Meta title="FSXA-API" subtitle="Communication with CaaS and navigation service easier than ever" />

In headless environments, the editorial content from FirstSpirit is provided via the CaaS. In turn, the navigation structure of the page can be accessed via the navigation service.

To make using these two services as easy as possible, we have developed the FSXA API. This project already provides a rich API to communicate with both services in a standardized way. It also transforms the responses of the CaaS and the navigation service and enriches them with other useful data.

For example, it converts the navigation service tree structure into easy to use maps and also extracts the start page directly.
The responses of the CaaS are transformed as well and unnecessary information for the frontend is removed.
